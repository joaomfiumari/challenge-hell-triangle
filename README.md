#PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE:

#Java was my choice as programming language, because is the language that I am more skilled. I've chose Java 8 because is the most updated version, I could have used Streams #and other new features but I've decided to let my code more readable. 

#PACKAGE MANAGER AND TEST FRAMEWORK:

#Maven was used as my package manager, I've decided to use JUnit 4.12 as my test framework, because I am more skilled using it. 

#RUN CONFIGURATIONS:

#Inside the directory:

mvn test 

#or you are able to see the surefire-reports inside the target directory
