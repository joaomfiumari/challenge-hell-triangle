Hell Triangle - B2W Challenge

#Programming Language:
Java was my choice as programming language because is the programming language that I am more experienced with. I've chose JDK8 because is the updated version. For this reason I had the option to use Streams and other features but I've decided to not use so I would let my code more readable.

#Package manager and Test Framework:

Maven was used as my package manager. JUnit(v4.12) was the test framework used, and I also used a continuous integration host (Travis CI) to automate the build and tests. So as soon as I update my code repository on GitHub, the build and all the tests are upload on my CI host (Travis CI) 

#Run config:

mvn test inside the directory or just see at:
